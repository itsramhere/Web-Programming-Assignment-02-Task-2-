                        Just as humans can be identified in many ways, so too can Internet hosts. One identifier for a host is its hostname.
                        Hosts are also identified by so-called IP addresses.  An IP address consists of four bytes and has a rigid hierarchical 
                        structure. An IP address looks like 121.7.106.83, where each period separates one of the bytes expressed in decimal 
                        notation from 0 to 255.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                            This is the main task of the Internet’s domain name system (DNS). The DNS is (1) a distributed database implemented 
                            in a hierarchy of DNS servers, and (2) an application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed 
                            database
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        DNS provides a few other important services in addition to translating hostnames to IP addresses: 
                        <dl>
                            <dt>
                                <b> Host aliasing </b>
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                 A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names.  Alias hostnames,
                                when present, are typically more mnemonic than canonical hostnames. 
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt> <b> Mail server aliasing </b></dt>
                            <dd>
                                
                                    For obvious reasons, it is highly desirable that e-mail addresses be mnemonic. DNS can be
                                    invoked by a mail application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname
                                    as well as the IP address of the host.
                                
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt> <b> Load distribution </b>  </dt>
                            <dd>
                                
                                    DNS is also used to perform load distribution among replicated servers, such as replicated Web servers.
                                    For replicated Web servers, a set of IP addresses is thus associated with one canonical hostname.
                                    The DNS database contains this set of IP addresses. When clients make a DNS query for a name
                                    mapped to a set of addresses, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the 
                                    ordering of the addresses within each reply. Because a client typically sends its HTTP request message to 
                                    the IP address that is listed first in the set, DNS rotation distributes the traffic among
                                    the replicated servers.
                                
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
                    </p>
