                        Just as humans can be identified in many ways, so too can Internet hosts. One identifier for a host is its hostname.
                        Hosts are also identified by so-called IP addresses.  An IP address consists of four bytes and has a rigid hierarchical 
                        structure. An IP address looks like 121.7.106.83, where each period separates one of the bytes expressed in decimal 
                        notation from 0 to 255.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                            This is the main task of the Internet’s domain name system (DNS). The DNS is (1) a distributed database implemented 
                            in a hierarchy of DNS servers, and (2) an application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed 
                            database
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        DNS provides a few other important services in addition to translating hostnames to IP addresses: 
                        <dl>
                            <dt>
                                <b> Host aliasing </b>
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                 A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names.  Alias hostnames,
                                when present, are typically more mnemonic than canonical hostnames. 
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt> <b> Mail server aliasing </b></dt>
                            <dd>
                                
                                    For obvious reasons, it is highly desirable that e-mail addresses be mnemonic. DNS can be
                                    invoked by a mail application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname
                                    as well as the IP address of the host.
                                
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt> <b> Load distribution </b>  </dt>
                            <dd>
                                
                                    DNS is also used to perform load distribution among replicated servers, such as replicated Web servers.
                                    For replicated Web servers, a set of IP addresses is thus associated with one canonical hostname.
                                    The DNS database contains this set of IP addresses. When clients make a DNS query for a name
                                    mapped to a set of addresses, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the 
                                    ordering of the addresses within each reply. Because a client typically sends its HTTP request message to 
                                    the IP address that is listed first in the set, DNS rotation distributes the traffic among
                                    the replicated servers.
                                
                            </dd>
                        </dl>

                    <h2>FTP - File Transfer Protocol</h2>
                    <time class="blog-date" datetime="2026-01-10T09:00">January 10, 2026 &bull; 9:00 AM</time>

                <div class="blog-content">
                    <p>
                         FTP uses two parallel TCP connections to transfer a file, a control connection and a data
                        connection. The control connection is used for sending control information between
                        the two hosts. The data connection is used to actually send a file. Because FTP 
                        uses a separate control connection, FTP is said to send its control information <b> out-of-band. </b>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When a user starts an FTP session with a remote host, the client side of FTP
                        (user) first initiates a control TCP connection with the server side (remote host) on
                        <i>server port number 21. </i>The client side of FTP sends the user identification and
                        password over this control connection. The client side of FTP also sends, over the
                        control connection, commands to change the remote directory. When the server
                        side receives a command for a file transfer over the control connection (either to,
                        or from, the remote host), the server side initiates a TCP data connection to the
                        client side. FTP sends exactly one file over the data connection and then closes the
                        data connection. If, during the same session, the user wants to transfer another file,
                        FTP opens another data connection. Thus, with FTP, the control connection
                        remains open throughout the duration of the user session, but a new data 
                        connection is created for each file transferred within a session (i.e, the data connections are non-persistent)
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Throughout a session, the FTP server must maintain state about the user. 
                        Keeping track of this state information for each ongoing user session significantly constrains
                        the total number of sessions that FTP can maintain simultaneously.
